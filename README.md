# Linking App Back

_Linking App Back_ is a NodeJS project which provides an API to allow _Linking Front_ customers access to some _Linking App_ information. Regarding technologies involved, the following list offer an application overview:

-   NodeJS
-   MongoDB
-   Javascript
-   Express
-   Passport (JWT)

## Authentication

JWT and traditional user/password login are available in this project. It is important to bear in mind that JWT is the standard authentication method for **/api`*`** routes.

In order to understand the implementation, it is required to review the following files:

-   ./src/controller/auth/passport/index.js
-   ./src/controller/auth/passport/strategies/local.js
-   ./src/controller/auth/passport/strategies/jwt.js
-   ./src/controller/auth/index.js
-   ./src/middlewares/passport/index.js
-   ./src/routes/api/auth/loginjwt.js

Basically, the procedure of protect api routes with JWT follows the following procedure:

-   An user access to http://server/api/login sending the respective credentials
-   "local" strategy comes into play verifying user's credentials provided previously and generating a new token
-   In the following user request, for example http://server/api/users?username=test02, user has to include a Bearer header with the token provided
-   "jwt" strategy comes into play in order to verify the token when route has isLogged middleware enabled

## Required Variables

A set of variables have to be defined in **.env** file in order to run the application properly. The following list includes these required variables:

## Models

There are some data models implemented on MongoDB in order to be able to implement the application logic.

### Users

_User_ is a MongoDB Object which has a set of fields which define ir personal information and preference about a future couple. The following list display the fields which are included in the data model:

-   Name
-   Lastname
-   Username
-   Password
-   Email
-   Role
-   Status
-   ConfimationCode
-   Chat

### Matches

_Matches_ is a model to save each user suggestions which have to be generated by match algorithm. On the other hand, this model hosts users app selections when they are surfing in the application.

It is important to bear in ming that this models contains references to _User_ model through MongoDB Object IDs.

-   User
-   Suggestions
-   Beloved
-   Lovers
-   Matches
